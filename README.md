## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

[Output](https://github.com/dharlerjr/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Images/Output_d1.PNG)


By examining their individual p-values, we see that the following variables/coefficients provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset...
* Intercept
* Vehicle Length
* Ground Clearance

Because our Multiple R-squared value is 0.71, and our p-value is 5.35e-11, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the slope of our linear regression model is not zero.

Furthermore, because our R-squared value is 0.71 >= 0.71, we can conclude that our linear model effectively predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
